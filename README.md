# 2022 Preseason

This repository will let you practice pushing and pulling and allow us to guage your skill in programming. You have two tasks:

1. Create a file called 'translator.py'. Your file should take a word of any length, and return each letter as numbers (using ascii). There should be spaces used throughout. For example, "apple" is returned as "097 112 112 108 101". Hint: understand how to convert characters to integers, and use the ".zfill()" function to ensure that each number is three digits.

2. Create a file called 'window.py'. Your file should use the pygame library to create a window titled 'Interface'. The window should contain your name, your grade, and a sentence of your choosing.
